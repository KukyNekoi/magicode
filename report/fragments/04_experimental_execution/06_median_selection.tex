% \section{Median selection}

% Our attention now is focused on the side-effects of sorting the small segments used on BFPRT in a in-place fashion. This is important as for each execution of BFPRT the elements on each index moves to their corresponding position in their local segment. Let us denote as $k$ the size of the median used on BFPRT, for now we fix this value for all our examples as $k=5$ unless stated otherwise.
