\section{Base benchmarking}
In experimental algorithms, the first step before engaging into a optimization job is to benchmark our current solutions in order to formulate our hypothesis and expectations. In this case we will check the behaivour of base implementations IQS and IIQS to understand better what IQS and IIQS is, what is happening when a worst case arises and to devise the next steps of this experimental development.

% REMEMBER TO ANSWER THEESE QUESTIONS:

% Is IIQS execution for repeated elements an instance of IQS worstcase?
% Does presortedness affect (I)IQS running time?
% Does the size of the elements stored in the stack affect its performance?
% It is worth to use iterative versions of BFPRT as approximate median selection?
% Are the average cases for repeated and non repeated classes the same?} %rewrit
% Can we tune (I)IQS to support repeated cases without affecting its average running time?
